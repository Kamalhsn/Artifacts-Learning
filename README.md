# Artifacts-Learning
###Developed a Machine Learning model for Brain-MRI image denenoising to reduce the operator dependency and get
better diagnostic accuracy. 
Machine Learning techniques with pre and post processing approaches includes data normalization, multi-wavelet
decomposition, principal component analysis, random forest and support vector machine.
